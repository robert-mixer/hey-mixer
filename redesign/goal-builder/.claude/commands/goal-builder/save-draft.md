# Save Goal Draft

Save the current goal draft to a file for review before creating in Linear.

## Instructions

**WRITE the goal content DIRECTLY to a file** in the PROJECT'S temp folder using the Write tool:

1. Create temp directory if needed:
```bash
mkdir -p .tmp
```

2. **Use Write tool to create the file directly**:
```
# Default location
Write(.tmp/goal-draft.md) with the complete goal content

# Or to a specific file if argument provided
Write(.tmp/$ARGUMENTS-draft.md) with the complete goal content
```

3. After writing, show the file:
```
Read(.tmp/goal-draft.md)
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- DO NOT show draft in chat then copy to file
- DO NOT use cat, echo, or heredoc commands
- DO use the Write tool to create the file directly
- DO use the Read tool to show what was written

After saving:
1. Confirm the file was saved successfully
2. Tell the user where the draft was saved
3. Remind them they can review/edit before creating in Linear
4. Ask if they're ready to create the goal ticket

## Output Format

```
âœ… Draft saved successfully to: .tmp/goal-draft.md

You can review or edit the draft before creating the Linear ticket.
When you're ready, I'll create the goal with this exact content.
