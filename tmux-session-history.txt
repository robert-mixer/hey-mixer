  Issue #11: Mixer Assistant Overview

  This issue seems to contain a concept overview for Mixer - a voice-driven,
   continuously recording assistant that lives in a terminal interface. From
   the preview, it describes Mixer as a passive listener that captures
  everything being said.

  💡 Recommendation

  Since you have a single comprehensive issue, this would make a perfect
  goal ticket on its own. This appears to be a foundational feature
  specification that could serve as the primary goal for building the Mixer
  Assistant.

  What would you like to do?

  A) Create a goal ticket from issue #11 (Mixer Assistant Overview)
  B) Read the full issue #11 first to understand all the details
  C) Create more specific issues first before grouping into goals
  D) View any existing draft goals

       7    Mixer is a voice-controlled assistant designed to run
           continuously in a terminal, passively recording all audio
           while being able to switch into an interactive mode through
           voice activation. Users can naturally invoke the system with
           "Hey Mixer" at any point during a conversation to get
           summaries, extract information, or analyze what's been
           discussed.

> /goal-builder:edit-draft is running… SYS-14
  ⎿  Allowed 4 tools for this command

● I see you want to edit draft goal SYS-14. I'm in NORMAL MODE (no
  --auto-update flag detected), so I'll work with you interactively and get
  your approval before updating Linear.

  Let me start by setting up a todo list for this editing task:

● First, let me load the current content of SYS-14 from Linear:

● Bash(mkdir -p .tmp && echo "Setting up temp directory for editing")
  ⎿  Setting up temp directory for editing

● Bash(python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/load_goal.py --goal-id "SYS-14"
      --description-only > .tmp/goal-draft.md && echo "✅ Loaded goal content to
       .tmp/goal-draft.md…)
  ⎿  ✅ Loaded goal content to .tmp/goal-draft.md

● Now let me initialize version tracking and save this as version 1:

● Bash(echo "1" > .tmp/goal-version.txt && cp .tmp/goal-draft.md
      .tmp/goal-draft-v1.md && echo "✅ Initialized version tracking with
      current Linear content as v1")
  ⎿  ✅ Initialized version tracking with current Linear content as v1

● Now let me show you the current content of SYS-14:

● Read(.tmp/goal-draft.md)
  ⎿  Read 94 lines

● 📝 Current Goal Content Loaded

  I've successfully loaded the current content of SYS-14: Voice-Activated
  Terminal Assistant System from Linear.

  I notice the current version uses asterisks (*) for bullet points instead
  of dashes (-). This is the actual content from Linear.

  What would you like to change in this goal?

  For example, I could help you:
  - Add more technical details or requirements
  - Expand on specific sections
  - Add implementation phases or priorities
  - Include additional examples
  - Modify the module structure
  - Add acceptance criteria or testing requirements
  - Adjust any of the existing content

  What changes would you like to make?
