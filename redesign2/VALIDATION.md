# Redesign v3 Validation Report

Comprehensive validation of the Mixer system redesign.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All planned components have been built and are ready for testing.

## What Was Built

### 1. Shared Configuration ✅

```
shared/
├── config.yaml    # Repository and workspace settings
└── .env          # API tokens (symlinked to all agents)
```

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for configuration
**Status**: Created and ready
**Used by**: All agents (via symlinks)

### 2. Goal Builder Agent ✅

**Complete self-contained workspace with:**

#### Bootstrap and Launch
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Auto-loaded bootstrap ("Run /prime first")
- ✅ `run.sh` - Agent launcher script
- ✅ Symlinks to shared config

#### Context Hierarchy (prompts/)
- ✅ `system.md` - Guardrails and policies (NO procedures)
- ✅ `developer.md` - MCP contracts (NO workflows)
- ✅ `user.md` - Greetings only

#### Commands (7 total)
- ✅ `prime.md` - Context loader with ## Read section
- ✅ `create-goal.md` - Create goal from GitHub issues (comprehensive)
- ✅ `edit-draft.md` - Edit existing draft goal (comprehensive)
- ✅ `show-issues.md` - Display open GitHub issues
- ✅ `show-drafts.md` - Display draft Linear goals
- ✅ `analyze-issues.md` - Suggest issue groupings
- ✅ `save-draft.md` - Save current draft to file

#### Skills (Deep Reference)
- ✅ `SKILL.md` - Metadata and quick reference
- ✅ `WORKFLOW.md` - Complete step-by-step procedures
- ✅ `TEMPLATES.md` - Goal ticket templates

#### Adapters
- ✅ `transforms/gh_to_linear.md` - Field mapping documentation
- ✅ `handoff/README.md` - Future researcher agent integration

#### Presets
- ✅ `run-presets.yaml` - Run modes (quick/default/deep/production)

#### Infrastructure
- ✅ `.claude/settings.json` - MCP configuration
- ✅ `AGENT.md` - Human documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Quick start guide
- ✅ Directory structure (out/.tmp/, archives/, drafts/)

**Line count**: ~4500+ lines of documentation and workflows
**MCP Integration**: GitHub + Linear servers configured
**Quality**: Comprehensive, no duplication

### 3. Orchestrator Agent ✅

**Simplified relay agent with:**

#### Core Files
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Bootstrap (relay role definition)
- ✅ `run.sh` - Launcher
- ✅ Symlinks to shared config

#### Context
- ✅ `prompts/system.md` - Orchestrator guardrails

#### Infrastructure
- ✅ `README.md` - Complete relay guide

**Line count**: ~800+ lines
**Complexity**: Intentionally minimal (relay only)
**No MCP**: Uses tmux for agent coordination

### 4. Architecture Documentation ✅

- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system overview
- ✅ `VALIDATION.md` - This file
- ✅ Design principles documented
- ✅ Migration path defined

## Design Principles Validation

### ✅ 1. Single Source of Truth

- [x] prompts/system.md: Policies (not procedures)
- [x] prompts/developer.md: Contracts (not workflows)
- [x] skills/WORKFLOW.md: Procedures (not policies)
- [x] commands: Execution (not policies)
- [x] No overlap or duplication

### ✅ 2. Progressive Disclosure

- [x] CLAUDE.md: Minimal bootstrap
- [x] /prime: Context loader
- [x] Skills: Deep reference
- [x] Commands: Action-specific
- [x] Agent gets what it needs, when needed

### ✅ 3. Clear File Purposes

Every file has:
- [x] Purpose comment at top
- [x] "LOADED BY" specification
- [x] "CONTAINS" description
- [x] "DOES NOT CONTAIN" boundaries

### ✅ 4. MCP-First

- [x] All GitHub operations via MCP
- [x] All Linear operations via MCP
- [x] No custom Python scripts
- [x] Standard protocol configuration

### ✅ 5. Comprehensive Commands

- [x] create-goal.md: ~400 lines
- [x] edit-draft.md: ~350 lines
- [x] Includes inline workflows
- [x] MCP usage instructions
- [x] Error handling

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Launch Goal Builder

```bash
cd redesign2/goal-builder
./run.sh

# Expected:
# - Claude CLI launches
# - CLAUDE.md auto-loads
# - Agent prompts to run /prime
```

#### Scenario 2: Initialize Context

```
/prime

# Expected:
# - Loads prompts/system.md
# - Loads prompts/developer.md
# - Loads skills/WORKFLOW.md
# - Loads skills/TEMPLATES.md
# - Loads transforms/gh_to_linear.md
# - Loads presets/run-presets.yaml
# - Reports: "✅ You are now fully initialized"
```

#### Scenario 3: Show Issues

```
/show-issues

# Expected:
# - Calls mcp__github__list_issues
# - Displays open issues
# - Shows issue numbers and titles
```

#### Scenario 4: Create Goal

```
/create-goal 11

# Expected:
# - Loads full issue #11 via MCP
# - Drafts goal content interactively
# - Saves to .tmp/goal-draft-v1.md
# - Shows draft to user
# - Asks for approval
# - Creates in Linear on approval
# - Closes GitHub issue
# - Archives all versions
```

#### Scenario 5: Launch via Orchestrator

```bash
cd redesign2/orchestrator
./run.sh

# Tell orchestrator:
"I want to create a goal from issue #11"

# Expected:
# - Orchestrator launches goal-builder in tmux
# - Sends /create-goal 11
# - Relays messages between user and agent
```

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Plan Builder**: Not yet implemented (future phase)
2. **Module Builder**: Not yet implemented (future phase)
3. **Researcher Agent**: Handoff structure created, not implemented
4. **Custom Presets**: Infrastructure ready, user customization not built
5. **Multi-Issue Analysis**: Basic support, could be enhanced

|--------|----------|----------|
| File Loading | Implicit | Explicit (/prime) |
| MCP Integration | Python scripts | MCP servers |
| Workspace Isolation | Shared scripts | Self-contained |
| Command Depth | ~50 lines | ~300-400 lines |
| Information Hierarchy | Mixed | Clear separation |
| Duplication | Some overlap | Single source of truth |
| Quality Bars | Implicit | Explicit and documented |
| Version Management | Basic | Comprehensive + archive |
| Auto-Update | Manual only | Flag + mid-workflow |
